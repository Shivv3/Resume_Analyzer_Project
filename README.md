# Resume Classification using NLP and Machine Learning
This repository contains a project on classifying resumes into different categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The project involves the preprocessing of resumes, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and classification using a machine learning model.

# Repository Contents
- Project Python File (Resume_Analyzer.ipynb): Contains the code for preprocessing the resumes, extracting features using TF-IDF, training the machine learning model, and making predictions on new resumes.
- Presentation (Resume_Classification_Presentation.pdf): A presentation summarizing the project, including the problem statement, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- Project Proposal (Project_Proposal.pdf): A detailed project proposal outlining the objectives, scope, methodology, and expected outcomes of the project.
- Dataset (resumes_dataset.csv ): The dataset of resumes used for training and testing the model. This includes labeled resumes categorized into different job roles.

# Project Overview
### Objectives:
- **Automate Resume Screening**: To develop a system that can automatically classify resumes into predefined categories to streamline the recruitment process.
- **NLP and Machine Learning**: To leverage NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms for classification.

# Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse set of resumes categorized by job roles.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean the text data by removing irrelevant information, tokenizing the text, and removing stopwords.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the text data into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Train a logistic regression model (or other classifiers) on the TF-IDF features to learn the patterns associated with each job category.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to classify new resumes into the predefined categories.

# Results
- **Accuracy and Performance**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Insights**: Analyze which features (words) are most indicative of each category.
